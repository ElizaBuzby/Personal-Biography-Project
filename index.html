            <p>Bowser, also known as King Koopa, is the main antagonist of the Super Mario franchise, as he has appeared in several spin-off games like Mario Party or Mario Kart, and mainline games like Super Mario 64, or the original Super Mario Bros. Bowser has become an icon of the series due to his many appearances in the series and out.</p>

        <section id="EarlyLife">
            <p>While Bowser's debut was in 1985's Super Mario Bros for the NES, his past wouldn't be revealed until 1995's Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, where we learn that the Mario Brothers and Bowser have known each other since they were babies. Here, we learn that Bowser was raised by a Magikoopa named Kamek, who aimed to raise Bowser to become an great king for the Koopa troop, which succeeded. Baby Bowser would continue to appear in several other games like Yoshi's Island DS, or Mario & Luigi: Partners in time, where he would meet his future self to fight the Mario Brothers and their baby counterparts. Besides those instances, we don't really know much about Bowser's past, nor do I think we'll ever know.</p>

            <p>Bowser is king of the Dark Lands, and is almost constantly seeking to rule the Mushroom Kingdom, even if it always backfires thanks to the Mario Brothers. However, that doesn't mean he hasn't done some good throughout the series. Bowser has teamed up with Mario on several occasions when they meet a mutual foe. This is seen in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, where not only did Bowser get involved in trying to stop the spreading of the Blorb virus, since it was starting to get to his troops as well, but he also saved the world from the Dark Star, even if it was because it was trying to conqure the kingdom that he was trying to conqure. In the side story for 3DS remake, we learn from Kamek that it's not fear that keeps the Koopa Troop on Bowser's side, but rather respect and admiration, basically confirming that Bowser is not a tyrannical ruler to his people. Bowser is even a good father to Bowser JR, beacause in Super Mario Sunshine, he lies to Junior, saying that Peach's his mother, only because he wants Junior to have a maternal figure.</p>
