        <h2>Bowser's Career & Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>Bowser is king of the Dark Lands, and is almost constantly seeking to rule the Mushroom Kingdom, even if it always backfires thanks to the Mario Brothers. However, that doesn't mean he hasn't done some good throughout the series. Bowser has teamed up with Mario on several occasions when they meet a mutual foe. This is seen in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, where not only did Bowser get involved in trying to stop the spreading of the Blorb virus, since it was starting to get to his troops as well, but he also saved the world from the Dark Star, even if it was because it was trying to conqure the kingdom that he was trying to conqure. In the side story for 3DS remake, we learn from Kamek that it's not fear that keeps the Koopa Troop on Bowser's side, but rather respect and admiration, basically confirming that Bowser is not a tyrannical ruler to his people. Bowser is even a good father to Bowser JR, beacause in Super Mario Sunshine, he lies to Junior, saying that Peach's his mother, only because he wants Junior to have a maternal figure.</p>
