        <h2>Bowser's Early Life</h2>
        <p>While Bowser's debut was in 1985's Super Mario Bros for the NES, his past wouldn't be revealed until 1995's Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, where we learn that the Mario Brothers and Bowser have known each other since they were babies. Here, we learn that Bowser was raised by a Magikoopa named Kamek, who aimed to raise Bowser to become an great king for the Koopa troop, which succeeded. Baby Bowser would continue to appear in several other games like Yoshi's Island DS, or Mario & Luigi: Partners in time, where he would meet his future self to fight the Mario Brothers and their baby counterparts. Besides those instances, we don't really know much about Bowser's past, nor do I think we'll ever know.</p>
