        <h2>Bowser's Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Bowser has had a crazy life throughout the Mario series, with many grand and ambitious plans. However, this list would get far, far too long if every single plan of his was mentioned, so only the highlights will be mentioned here. In 2007's Super Mario Galaxy, Bowser went beyond the Mushroom Kingdom, and went for the stars, abducting Peach's Castle with UFOs, sending Mario into deep space, and forming a stronghold at the center of the universe itself. In Super Mario 3D World, he kidnapped all the fairies in the Sprixie Kingdom, and formed his own amusment park, World Bowser. The boss fight here would also be one of the few times when Bowser utilized the same power-ups that Mario used throughtout his adventure. In Super Mario Bros 3, when it was a stage play, it featured one of Bowser's most clever plots yet. He had his children, the Koopalings, transform the kings of nearby kingdoms, luring Mario out of the castle, and giving Bowser the perfect oppurtunity to kindap the princess.</p>
        <p>Bowser has a rather large amount of relationships over the nearly 40 year history of the series, whether familial, diplomatic, or romantic. He has 8 children, with only one seemingly being fully biological, that being Bowser Junior. His other kids are Lemmy, Larry, Ludwig, Morton, Roy, Wendy, Iggy. They call themselves the Koopalings. Speaking of familial relations, there's also his paternal figure, Kamek. And of course, in terms of diplomatic relations, there are also his Koopa Troop, who he respects, hence why they follow his every command. And of course, there is his nemesis, Mario, and his brother Luigi.</p>
